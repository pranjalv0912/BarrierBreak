Create an EC2 instance and select the operating system as Ubuntu
 

Create a new key-pair and allow HTTP traffic for the instance and then launch the instance

Now paste the IP of the instance and associate the Elastic IP to the instance
 

After all these steps, install PuTTY software from the Microsoft Store and open it.
